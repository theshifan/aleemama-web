        It Started With a Grandmother Who Said "No."
      </h2>

      <p style={paraStyle}>
        When a grandmother picked up a jar of baby food from the store and read the label sugar, preservatives,
        ingredients she couldn't even pronounce she knew something was wrong.
      </p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>"I wouldn't feed this to my grandchild," she said.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>So she did what grandmothers do best. She made it herself.</p>
      <p style={paraStyle}>
        Real apples. Real carrots. Real grains. Carefully dehydrated, ground into fine powder, and packed with the
        same love she'd put into every meal she'd ever made for her family.
      </p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>No shortcuts. No chemicals. No compromises.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>Just pure, natural nutrition the way food was meant to be.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}><strong>That's How aleeMAMA Was Born.</strong></p>

      <p style={paraStyle}>
        We're not a factory. We're not mass producing thousands of units a day.
        We're a home grown brand, making small batches in our own space, with the same care and attention a
        grandmother would give her own family. Every jar is made fresh. Every ingredient is real.
      </p>


      {/* ── SECTION 2: Why We Do This ── */}
      <p style={centreStyle}>
        Every product meets one simple standard: Would we feed this to our own children?
      </p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>If the answer is no, it doesn't leave our kitchen.</p>
      <div style={dividerStyle} />

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Why We Do This</h2>

      <p style={paraStyle}>
        Because somewhere along the way, "healthy food" became full of sugar, preservatives, and artificial flavors.
        Baby food that isn't really food. Juices with more chemicals than fruit. "Natural" products that are anything but.
      </p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>We believe your family deserves better.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>Real ingredients. Real nutrition. Real care.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>No added sugar. No preservatives. No artificial anything.</p>
      <p style={centreStyle}>Just food the way nature intended and the way your grandmother would approve.</p>
